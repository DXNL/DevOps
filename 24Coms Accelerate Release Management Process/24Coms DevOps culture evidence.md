Our journey started with a meeting between 24Coms and Microsoft where we talked about how to practice more agile software development by applying DevOps practices. During this meeting, we narrowed down the options to executable and doable steps that would be inline and helpful to their DevOps journey.  The decision was made to deliver a Value Stream Map (VSM) workshop followed by a DevOps hackfest. First we did a 1 day VSM workshop at mid-August 2016 followed by a 3-day hackfest in Mid-September 2016.

 
## Problem Statement ##

24Coms teamed-up with Microsoft to optimize and accelerate their overall delivery pipeline and capacity to provision new customers to their platform. To discover areas of improvement and to narrow down the focus areas for the hackfest the team meet and started their DevOps journey with a Value Stream Map workshop. 

Before starting the Value Stream Map process an agreement was made on what the focus of the workshop should be regarding the solution and its components. The 24Coms team wanted to focus on their recently refactored backend service called “Follow me”. Previously this was a big monolithic application and they turned this into a micro service based application. 

24Coms designed this solution as an Azure Service Fabric implementation and already they are running their production environment on this new architecture. The focus of the conversation with 24Coms was on the operations pipeline and we discovered that most of the impact during the hackfest could be at this backend service. The next step was the Value Stream Map workshop.

In the VSM workshop we captured the high-level conceptual architecture of the solution, so everyone could understand what the solution would look like and what the characteristics of a micro service implementation are.
